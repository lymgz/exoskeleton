# A Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis for the exoskeleton potential application in the field of construction
A Bayesian model-averaged  meta-analysis code and source data on exoskeletons in the field of construction, refers to the journal paper.

## Abstract
The integration of exoskeleton technology in construction significantly enhances worker safety and operational efficiency. However, its broader adoption is constrained by comfort issues and the lack of definitive evidence demonstrating its benefits. This study employs both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analytical approaches to critically assess existing research on the effect sizes of construction exoskeletons. Our analysis identifies substantial gaps in detailed assessments of user comfort, particularly concerning material selection and muscle activity. By comparing with similar meta-analyses from previous research, this study highlights existing heterogeneity and quantifies the cumulative effect sizes from 30 experimental studies. Additionally, this research utilizes a novel multi-tooled bibliometric method for literature exclusion, contributing a methodological innovation. Overall, this research aims to provide insights for future experimental studies on exoskeletons, advocate for their wider application in the construction industry, and enhance the overall well-being of workers.
